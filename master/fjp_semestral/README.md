# FJP semestral
- supposed theme: PL/0 compiler with simple IDE in JS/ web
- the first draft grammar seems too simple - can it work? should it include various types?

TURN-IN CHECKLIST:
- integer:
    - [x] \+
    - [x] \-
    - [x] \*
    - [x] /
    - [x] =
    - [x] \#
    - [x] <
    - [x] <=
    - [x] \>
    - [x] \>=
- float:
    - [x] \+
    - [x] \-
    - [x] \*
    - [x] /     - only works "somewhat" (it seems periodic numbers don't work e.g.: 1/3)
    - [x] =
    - [x] \#
    - [x] <
    - [x] <=
    - [x] \>
    - [x] \>=
- boolean:
    - [x] ~
    - [x] &
    - [x] |
    - [x] =
    - [x] \#
- string: --- CANCELED
    - [ ] \+
    - [ ] =
    - [ ] \#
- [x] if
- [x] else
- [x] while
- [x] for
- [x] return value - tested integer only (TODO: test other data types)
- [ ] multiple assignment --- CANCELED
- [x] parallel assignment
- [x] expression priority with - tried with booleans, seems to work (TODO: test other data types)
- [x] parameters
- [x] ternary - its useless, cannot be used to assign values to variables... basically if with different syntax
- [x] AND, OR, NEG (in some basic form)
